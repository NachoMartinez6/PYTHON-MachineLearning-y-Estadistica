# Statistics-With-Python
In this folder, we will be focusing on main algorithms that we can use with Python. Above all, we explain all the procces to load, clean and explore our data before building our model. Libraries like sklearn, statmodels or scipy we will be using to create, evaluate or change our model.

Also, I try to describe and give a brief introduction to each library and explain why I will use one or other. I hope this information helps you and give you a good contact to basic models and statistics to create different projects and obtain valuable information through the data.

All the best
